I am an assistant professor in the [CSE department](https://cse.osu.edu/) at The Ohio State University and a part-time research scientist at [Yahoo! Research](https://research.yahoo.com/). My research interest is in theoretical and applied machine learning with fairness and privacy guarantees, robust machine learning, distributed learning, and efficient machine learning for tiny devices.
